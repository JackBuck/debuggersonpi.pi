---Instructions for using the makefile---

The makefile is linked from the renispace builds directory.
This is where the project should be built.

That is, to make the project, run
cd ~/renispace_build
make all

The executable created is called renispace.

NOTE: If any new .cpp files have been added to the project then they will need to be added to the SRCS variable in the makefile to be part of the build.

In order to clean the build, run
make clean

Or to simply remove the object files, run
make cleanobj
